# Harvard CS50P

This is a collection of notes, examples and projects I've done while picking Python back up in preperation for AI/ML learning.

Update: This course appears too easy given my previous experience, I mainly have decided to use it as a re-entry to python, but feel I no longer need to continue with this.
